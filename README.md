This is the JavaScript framework for working with Thalmic Labs Myo.

The Myo armband measures the electrical activity from your muscles to detect what gesture your hand is making. It also senses all of the motions and rotations of your hand and forearm.

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/logotype/myojs.git`.
MyoJS is dependent on the [myodaemon OSX app](https://github.com/logotype/myodaemon/blob/master/build/myodaemon.zip?raw=true), source code available here `git clone git://github.com/logotype/myodaemon.git`.

Create an instance of the `Hub` class:

```javascript
    const hub = Myo.Hub();

    hub.on('ready', () => {
        console.log('ready');
    });
    hub.on('connect', () => {
        console.log('connected');
    });
    hub.on('frame', (frame) => {
        // Get the most recent frame and report some basic information
    	console.log('Frame id: ' + frame.id + ', timestamp: ' + frame.timestamp);
    });
    hub.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('disconnect');
    });
```

What you'll get from the `frame` handler is a `Frame` instance, with properties such as `Quaternion`, `Matrix`, `Pose` and more.
